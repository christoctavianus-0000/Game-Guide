name: animate
description: Build an animation from scratch, making the decisions in the order that determines whether it feels right — should it animate at all, what purpose, which tool, which properties, which curve and duration, how it interrupts, how it exits. Writes the implementation. Use when asked to animate something, add motion, make a component feel alive, or build a transition.

# Building Animations

A construction skill. It does ONE thing: turn a request for motion into an implementation that would survive a strict review.

## The Build Sequence

### 1. Should this animate at all?

| Frequency | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| 100+ times/day (keyboard shortcuts, command palette toggle) | **No animation. Ever.** Stop here. |
| Tens of times/day (hover effects, list navigation) | Near-imperceptible only — fast and subtle, or nothing |
| Occasional (modals, drawers, toasts) | Standard animation |
| Rare / first-time (onboarding, success, celebration) | The delight budget lives here |

### 2. What is the purpose?

Name it in one of these words before continuing:

- **Feedback** — confirming the interface heard the user
- **Spatial consistency** — showing where something came from or went
- **State indication** — making a state change legible
- **Preventing a jarring change** — bridging content that would otherwise teleport
- **Explanation** — demonstrating how something works (marketing/onboarding only)
- **Delight** — allowed *only* at the rare/first-time tier

### 3. Pick the tool — cheapest that works

| Need | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| Hover, press, color, a state toggle you control with a class or attribute | **CSS transition** |
| Entry animation on mount, no JS state | **CSS `@starting-style`** |
| Predetermined motion that must stay smooth while the page is busy loading | **CSS animation** (runs off the main thread) |
| Programmatic control with CSS performance, no library | **WAAPI** (`element.animate()`) |
| Springs, layout animations, exit animations, gesture-driven values | **Motion** (`motion.dev`) |

### 4. Pick the properties

- **`transform` and `opacity` only.** They skip layout and paint and run on the GPU.
- **Never `scale(0)`.** Start from `scale(0.9–0.97)` + `opacity: 0`.
- **Percentages in `translate()`** are relative to the element's own size.

### 5. Easing and duration — or a spring

**Easing**, in decision order:

| Situation | Easing |
| --- | --- |
| Entering or exiting | `ease-out` |
| Moving / morphing on screen | `ease-in-out` |
| Hover / color change | `ease` |
| Constant motion (marquee, progress) | `linear` |
| Default | `ease-out` |

```css
--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1);
--ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1);
--ease-drawer: cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1);
```

**Duration:**

| Element | Duration |
| --- | --- |
| Button press feedback | 100–160ms |
| Tooltips, small popovers | 125–200ms |
| Dropdowns, selects | 150–250ms |
| Modals, drawers | 200–500ms |
| Marketing / explanatory | Can be longer |

### 6. Interruption and exit

- **Transitions, not keyframes, for anything triggered rapidly**
- **Exit the way it entered.** Symmetric paths make interactions feel obvious.
- **Asymmetric timing where the user is deciding.** Slow on deliberate phase, snappy on system response.

### 7. Reduced motion and pointer gating

Ships with the animation, every time.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .element { animation: fade 0.2s ease; }
}

@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
  .element:hover { transform: scale(1.05); }
}
```

## Never Ship

| Never | Instead |
| --- | --- |
| `transition: all` | Name the exact properties |
| `transform: scale(0)` entrance | `scale(0.95)` + `opacity: 0` |
| `ease-in` on a UI element | `ease-out` or a strong custom curve |
| Built-in `ease-out` on a deliberate animation | `cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)` |
| Animation on a keyboard shortcut or 100+/day action | No animation |
| UI duration over 300ms with no reason | 150–250ms |
| Ungated `:hover` motion | `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` |
| Missing `prefers-reduced-motion` | Gentler variant, not zero |
| Everything entering at once | 30–80ms stagger |
